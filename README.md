# Go JWT Server

[![Go JWT Server CI](https://github.com/spdeepak/go-jwt-server/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/spdeepak/go-jwt-server/actions/workflows/go.yml)

This is a lightweight, work-in-progress JWT authentication server built with Golang. It focuses on providing
foundational security features such as flexible key management (via a master or secret key), refresh token rotation, and
token fingerprinting based on client metadata like IP address and user agent. Designed with security in mind, this
server aims to be a solid base for scalable authentication in modern applications. More features and improvements are
planned as development progresses.

## Features

* üîê **Secure Key Management**: Supports either a user-provided secret key or a master key that generates, encrypts (with
  the master key), and stores a Base64-encoded secret key in the database for signing JWT tokens, enabling an additional
  security layer by default.

* üîÅ **Refresh Token Rotation**: Implements automatic refresh token rotation ‚Äî each time a refresh token is used to
  obtain a new token pair, the existing refresh token is revoked and replaced, reducing the risk of replay attacks and
  token leakage.

* üÜî **Token Fingerprinting**: Binds tokens to individual clients using a fingerprint generated from IP address, device
  name, and user-agent data. This fingerprint is stored in the database and verified on each request to prevent token
  theft and unauthorized reuse.

## Configuration

### Environment variables

| variable name            | Type                    | Required            | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| `JWT_MASTER_KEY`         | base64-encoded `string` | $\textnormal{No}^1$ |         | If provided, the server generates a secure random secret key internally, encrypts it using the decoded value of `JWT_MASTER_KEY`, and stores the encrypted key (base64-encoded) in the database. The decoded master key will be used at runtime to decrypt the stored secret and sign JWT tokens. This provides an extra layer of security by not storing the signing secret in plaintext. It should be 32 bytes long for `AES-256`. |
| `JWT_SECRET_KEY`         | base64-encoded `string` | $\textnormal{No}^1$ |         | Used directly (after decoding) as the key to sign JWT tokens. Required if `JWT_MASTER_KEY` is not set. Ensure this key is strong and securely managed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

$\textnormal{ }^1$Note: Either `JWT_MASTER_KEY` or `JWT_SECRET_KEY` must be provided. If both are provided, `JWT_MASTER_KEY` takes
precedence, and the secret key will be internally managed as described above.
